# CS50x – Week 0: Scratch

This week focuses on understanding the fundamentals of computer science through visual programming with Scratch.

## What I learned
- How to think algorithmically
- Breaking down a problem into smaller steps
- Using sequences, loops, conditionals, and events
- Basic concepts of inputs, outputs, and variables

## Project
For Week 0, I created a Scratch project that demonstrates:
- Event-driven programming
- Conditional logic
- Repetition (loops)
- User interaction

The project was built following CS50x guidelines and submitted via the official CS50 submission system.

## Notes
This project represents my first step in the CS50x journey.  
The focus is on logic and problem-solving rather than visual perfection.
